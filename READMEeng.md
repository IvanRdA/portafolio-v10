# Portfolio web version 1.0 - Showcase Version

## Overview:

This project represents the initial development version of my web portfolio as a fullstack developer. The project is simple and consists solely of frontend (without backend or database) as I utilize data mocking to handle and interact with the dynamically generated content of the portfolio.
Despite its small scale and intended purpose for showcasing, I have chosen to implement it using NextJS, allowing for potential scalability in the future by adding supplementary infrastructure components.

The selected technologies include React with NextJS and TailwindCSS for styling. Additionally, the implementation relies on i18n for multilingual support.

**Note: Responsive optimization is not fully completed.**

## Installation and Configuration:
